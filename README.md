# 30 Days of Verilog

<p align="center">
  Embark on a journey through 30 days of Verilog exploration! ðŸŒŸ
</p>

Welcome to my personal project: **30 Days of Verilog**. Over the next 30 days, I'll be taking a deep dive into the world of digital circuits and Verilog programming. My goal is to create and showcase 30 different digital circuits, each implemented using Verilog HDL.

## About the Project

The aim of this project is to:

- **Learn Verilog**: Gain a solid understanding of Verilog and its applications.
- **Explore Digital Circuits**: Create a variety of digital circuits to explore different concepts.
- **Document Progress**: Document my journey, challenges, and solutions for each circuit.
- **Share with the Community**: Provide a resource for others interested in Verilog and digital design.

## Repository Structure

Each day, I will add a new folder from **Day 1** to **Day 30**, containing:

- **Verilog Code**: Implementation of the day's digital circuit in Verilog.
- **README**: Explanation of the circuit, its purpose, and my approach.
- **Simulation**: Simulation results, waveforms, and test benches (if applicable).
- **Reflections**: Insights and lessons learned during the implementation.

Feel free to follow along, offer suggestions, or learn from my progress!
